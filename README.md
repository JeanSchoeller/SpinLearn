# SpinLearn

In this project, we try to predict the diamater, morphologies and electrospinnability of electrospun nanofibers using supervised and unsupervised techniques.

Electrospinning is a powerful method to produce non-woven fiber meshes/membranes from polymer solutions or polymer melts and has been described in detail by several research groups. As the term electrospinning indicates, fibers are generated by applying a high voltage in the range of kV to overcome the surface tension of a polymer solution. The electrical force causes the pendant polymer droplet at the tip of the spinneret (blunt needle tip) to become charged and the accumulation of charges on the surface of the droplet deforms it into a cone shape referred to as Taylor's cone.
